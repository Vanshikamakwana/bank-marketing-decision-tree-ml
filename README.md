# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify transactions as legitimate or fraud based on transaction features.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling imbalanced dataset
4. Feature engineering
5. Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
6. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Results

Random Forest model performed better in detecting fraudulent transactions and improved recall score.

## Business Impact

Helps financial institutions detect fraud transactions early and reduce financial losses.
